## What is fixflex?

**Fixflex** is a platform that connects people who need tasks done with individuals who are willing to complete those tasks for pay. It operates like traditional freelancing platforms such as *Upwork*, *Fiverr*, and *Freelancer*, where users can post tasks or jobs and taskers make offers on these tasks. The user then selects the most suitable tasker for the job. However, the main difference between **fixflex** and traditional freelancing platforms lies in their primary objectives. While platforms like *Upwork* primarily focus on digital services such as programming, writing, and design, **fixflex**'s core mission is to facilitate the completion of a wide range of everyday tasks and services. **Fixflex** specializes in connecting people who need tasks like plumbing, electricity, painting, cleaning, gardening, moving, cooking, and more with handymen who are willing to perform these tasks for pay.
